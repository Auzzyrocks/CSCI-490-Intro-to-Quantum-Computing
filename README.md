# CSCI-490-Intro-to-Quantum-Computing
Repository containing the results of my CSCI 490 Independent Research Project, studying quantum computing. This project was intended as an exploration of quantum computing, from the fundemental concepts, through hardware and software, to basic algorithms. I believe the final document and video presentation will serve as a useful introduction to quantum computing, for anyone with an undergraduate level computer science education. 

The 'CSCI 490 Final Report' pdf is the complete document containg the results of this project in written form. 

A video of the presentation can be found at: https://youtu.be/Pg08jAmoGok

The 'Presentation Slides' pdf contains the slides used in this presentation.
